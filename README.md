## About Invictus
Invictus is a set of jupyter notebooks showcasing how to accomplish specific computer vision task using the Python programming language.

### Setting Up
It is generally encouraged that you always use Python virtuan environment to have isolated Python installations per project. In this guide, I suggest you do the same. So 'cd' into the 'invictus' directory that you've cloned onto your computer and perform the following actions to run the notebooks in a separate virtual environment.

1. ```python3 -m venv env```
2. ```source /env/bin/activate```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```jupyter notebook```

### Opening Notebooks
In invictus, every notebook is self-contained and demonstrates end-to-end flow of actions that must be taken to accomplish a given task. The name of a notebook file suggests its purpose.

Once you've started jupyter notebooks with the command ```jupyter notebook``` you must open http://localhost:8888/ in your browser to see the tree of files and directories in invictus.

Click on the ```notebooks``` folder and select your notebook of choice to see the code demonstration.
